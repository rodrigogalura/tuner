# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## 1. Why use Tuner instead of Laravel API Resource?

<sup>Tuner doesn’t replace Laravel’s API Resources — it complements them. While Laravel focuses on how developers structure and shape API responses, Tuner is built from the consumer’s perspective. It gives API consumers the flexibility to tweak responses directly — selecting fields, filtering, sorting, and more — without requiring backend changes.</sup>

## 2. Is Tuner compatible with Laravel Latest?

<sup>Yes. Tuner is fully compatible with:</sup>

<sup>- Laravel versions: 10, 11, and 12</sup>

<sup>- PHP versions: 8.0 up to 8.3</sup> 

> <sup>It follows Laravel’s latest conventions and integrates cleanly into modern Laravel projects.</sup>

## 3. Is Tuner prone to SQL Injection?

<sup>It uses Laravel’s Query Builder and Eloquent ORM under the hood, which automatically applies parameter binding to all queries. This ensures that any user-supplied values — such as filters, search terms, or sort parameters — are safely escaped and do not directly affect raw SQL.</sup>

<sup>Tuner also sanitizes operators and validates query syntax internally, adding an extra layer of protection.</sup>

> <sup>As always, follow Laravel best practices and avoid exposing raw database input to untrusted users.</sup>

## 4. Does Tuner support Eloquent relationships?

<sup>Absolutely. Tuner was built with Eloquent in mind. It fully supports all relationship types:</sup>

<sup>- HasOne</sup>

<sup>- HasMany</sup>

<sup>- BelongsTo</sup>

<sup>- BelongsToMany</sup>

> <sup>These relationships can be expanded, filtered, searched, projected, and more — directly from the query string.</sup>

<br>

## 5. Can I use Tuner in existing Laravel APIs?

<sup>Yes, you can integrate Tuner into an existing API with minimal effort.</sup>

> <sup>As long as your models follow standard Eloquent practices, you can immediately start using features like filtering, projection, and expansion in your current endpoints without rewriting your logic.</sup>

## 6. Is Tuner configurable?

<sup>Yes, it’s designed with flexibility in mind.</sup>

<sup>You can:</sup>

<sup>- Customize the query parameter names if you prefer different conventions.</sup>

<sup>- Enable or disable specific features.</sup>

<sup>- Extend or override behaviors such as filter operators, field resolution, or pagination format.</sup>

> <sup>A configuration file is published where you can fine-tune how Tuner behaves in your application.</sup>

## 6. Does Tuner affect performance?

<sup>Tuner uses lazy loading prevention and intelligent query optimization under the hood to avoid N+1 problems and unnecessary data loading.</sup>

> <sup>However, like any abstraction, you should benchmark performance on large datasets and use Laravel’s tools like eager loading (with) or indexes as needed.</sup>

<br>

## 7. Do you have an API collection to easily explore the features?

<sup>Yes, I provide a [Bruno](https://github.com/rodrigogalura/tuner/tree/main/stubs/bruno-collection) collection to help you explore and test the features out of the box.</sup>

> <sup>If you’re using a different API client like *Postman* or *Insomnia*, you can easily convert the Bruno collection using available tools or export options.</sup>
